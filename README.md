# MyReads Project

You can use this application to keep track of all the books you want to read!

## 1) Running the application
Start the application by running `npm run start`. Then navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser. You should now be at the main page.

## 2) View the books you have saved
You should now be at the main screen of the application. Here's where you can see all the books you have saved and the different shelves for these books.

### Managing your books
Click on the bottom right hand icon of the book where there is an green indicator for a dropdown menu. From there, you can select the appropriate shelf for the book to be on.

## 3) Add new books to your shelves
Click on the bottom right hand icon (you should see a plus sign) to go to the search page, where you can add more books.

You can also manage your books from here by clicking the same green indicator for the dropdown menu on the bottom right hand corner of the book.

Happy reading!
